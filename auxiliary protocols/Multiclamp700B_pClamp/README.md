This folder contains a Windows Batch file that directly starts the python script [MCC_get_settings](https://github.com/neuronex-wm/ipfx/blob/master/ipfx/bin/mcc_get_settings.py) by executing it without the need to start the command line and type. For the use on other computers the following paths have to be adjusted:

1) the path to your python; for example 'C:\Users\User1\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python.exe'
2) the path to ipfx/mcc_get_settings to execute the script, for example C:\Users\User1\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Lib\site-packages\ipfx\bin\mcc_get_settings.py
3) the path to the folder where pCLAMP recordings are saved to, for example: C:\Users\User1\Documents\'Molecular Devices'\pCLAMP\Data
