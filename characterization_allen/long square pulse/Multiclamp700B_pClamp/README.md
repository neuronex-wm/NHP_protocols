If recording from cells with extremely low input resistance (< 50 MOhm) the pipette compensation with Multiclamp 700B, will be off significantly unless the feedback resistor is switched from 500 to 50 MOhm. Hence we have protocols for both. It is reasonable to assume that the resistance during the ongoing 1 second stimuluation is lower than at rest due to additional voltage-gated conductances. Hence using the feedback resistor for cells below 100 MOhm or even 150 MOhm is a good idea.
