# NHP_protocols
Collection of protocols for recordings for the IRG2 Primate cell type database. The point of this repository is to facilitate and ensure standardized acquisition  protocols.
Please make sure that the protocols you use are in line with the consesus template and upload them here. Only use the protocols uploaded here. If you change your acquisition protocol update the respective file here.

If recording from cells with extremely low input resistance (< 50 MOhm) the pipette compensation with Multiclamp 700B, will be off significantly unless the feedback resistor is  switched from 500 to 50 MOhm. Hence we have protocols for both.
