# NHP_protocols

Collection of protocols for recordings for the IRG2 Primate cell type database. The purpose of this repository is to facilitate and ensure standardized acquisition  protocols as well as to provide a platform to exchange files needed for data acquisition. The acquisition protocols are stored in a folder structure based on protocol type and recording equipment. A template in "proto-code" for the standardized non-PatchSeq protocols based on the Allen Insitute for Brain Science can be found [here](characterization_allen/template.md). Protocols that are part of the standardized characterization are stored in the respective [folder](characterization_allen/). In addition, protocols outside of the Allen characterization block like different kind of noise stimuli should have their own folder.  


# Recommendations
Please deposite your files in a folder that contains keywords that references aquisition hard- and software in the following manner amplifier_software (example: Multiclamp700B_pClamp). Please create a respective folder if you need to. There are some prepared folders for each IRG2 lab, but please check if they are acurate and only use a folder with the appropiate name. 
Please make sure that the protocols you use are in line with the consesus template and upload these here. Only use the protocols uploaded here. If you change your acquisition protocol update the respective file here first, before acquiring data for NeuroNex.
